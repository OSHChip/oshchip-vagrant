Getting started with OSHChip Vagrant evironment.

Use `vagrant ssh` to enter the build evironment.
The directory `/vagrant` is mirror from your current directory.

This allows you to use your normal editor for work, then build from
within the VirtualBox VM.


After running `vagrant ssh` you can compile the example project.

cd /vagrant/devel/OSHChip_Blinky_Demo
make
make flash
